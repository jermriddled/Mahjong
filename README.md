# Mahjong
Calculates the odds of Tenhou in Mahjong. Tenhou is a type of hand in Mahjong in which all 14 tiles that are dealt to the dealer constitute a winning hand immediately at the beginning of the game - an exceedingly rare occurrence.

The program first builds a tileset. Then, it accepts user input. Following that, a hand of 14 random tiles is drawn and checked to see if it satisfies the condition for a Tenhou.  This is repeated however many times the user specifies, then each Tenhou achieved is displayed, along with the total number achieved and the percentage of the total amount of draws that were Tenhous.
